Hi there, my name is Alexandre Flores and I am a graduate student of Computer Science & Engineering. I am currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Graphics and Language Engineering.

I love game development and seek to improve my skills and learn. I am also currently working on and off on a Unity 2D hobby project.
